## Notes

**WebGl** : js Api for rendering 3d graphics in web browser using GPU.
**GPU** : special type of hardware that can run simple calculations in parallel.
**3.js?** :- Three.js is a JavaScript library that uses WebGL to render 3D graphics in a web browser.
**Components of 3.js**
*Scene, Camera, and Renderer:*
**Scene**: The container where everything lives (models, lights, cameras).
**Renderer**: The engine that calculates and draws the final image onto the screen using WebGL.
**Camera**: Your viewport into the 3D world (what the user sees).
That's a great next step! Understanding the two main camera types is absolutely key to making your scene look right.
The two main camera types in Three.js are:
PerspectiveCamera üåé - (fov,aspectratio,near,far)
OrthographicCamera üìê - (left,right,top,bottom,near,far)
**The PerspectiveCamera** : It works just like your eye or a real camera: objects look smaller the further away they are. It gives your scene depth and realism.

**FOv** - vertical angle of your viewing cone. (How wide the view is.)	
(Set between 50 and 75). A smaller number "zooms in" (telephoto); a larger number "zooms out" (wide-angle).
**Aspect Ratio** - The shape of your screen. 
Must be calculated as window.innerWidth / window.innerHeight to match your canvas.
**Near** - The closest an object can be before it vanishes.	Set a small number like 0.1. 
**Far** - The farthest an object can be before it vanishes.	Set a large number like 1000. 
**The OrthographicCamera** : is used for technical drawings, 2D games, or UI elements. It treats every object as if it's the same distance away, so a cube far away looks the exact same size as the same cube up close.



**OrbitControls** 
The OrbitControls is a utility that allows the user (you) to interactively move the camera around a central point in the scene using a mouse or touch input. It handles all the complex math for rotation, panning, and zooming so you don't have to write it yourself.

*properties:*
new OrbitControls(camera, canvas) = Initializes the controls.	Links the camera (what's moving) to the canvas (where the input is detected).
controls.enableDamping = true;	Enables a slight friction/momentum.	Makes camera movement feel smoother.
controls.autoRotate = true;	Sets the camera to spin automatically.	Makes the object slowly turn when the user isn't interacting with the scene.
controls.update() = Calculates new positions.	Must be called in the render loop to apply the effects of damping and auto-rotate every frame.

**RenderLoop**
the Render Loop is the continuous function that runs to update your scene 60 times per second
*window.requestAnimationFrame(renderLoop)*	- The function call that powers the loop.	Asks the browser to call renderLoop again before the next screen refresh. This is efficient and keeps the frame rate smooth.
*renderer.render(scene, camera)*

**Resizing**
when a user changes the size or shape of the browser window, the 3D scene doesn't look stretched or squished.
*camera.aspect = W / H;*- Updates the camera's shape
*renderer.setSize(W, H);* -	Updates the drawing area.
*camera.updateProjectionMatrix();*	- Forces the camera to recalculate its view
